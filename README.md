# Pandoc S3 Lambda converter

Lambda function that waits for files uploaded to S3, converts them to docx using the [Pandoc Lambda Layer](https://github.com/effortless-serverless/pandoc-aws-lambda-binary) and uploads back to S3.

This example shows how to wire up S3 file conversion that runs an external processor, in this case [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), a Swiss army knife for document conversion. Check out the [Running Pandoc on Lambda Guide](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/pandoc-lambda.html) for more information.

## Prerequisites

* create a S3 bucket for file uploads

## Setting up the converter

1. run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies
2. run `npm start` to deploy the initial lambda version
3. modify the [package.json](package.json) `connect` script to use your bucket name
4. run `npm run connect` to configure your S3 bucket to invoke the lambda function when a new file is uploaded to the `/in` directory

## Try it out

Once you've installed everything, send a test file, for example a markdown file, to your bucket using the S3 console, or the AWS CLI tools. The command lines below assume the bucket is called `pandoc-test-bucket`, so adjust the commands for your bucket name accordingly.  The convert.js code assumes that there is a template docx at the root of the bucket.  See: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--reference-doc

```bash
aws s3 cp reference.docx s3://pandoc-test-bucket/reference.docx
```

```bash
aws s3 cp example.md s3://pandoc-test-bucket/in/example.md
```

Wait a few seconds, and then check if the `/out` folder of your S3 bucket

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://pandoc-test-bucket/out/
```

Download the file with the same base name, but the `docx` extension, from the `/out` folder:

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://pandoc-test-bucket/out/example.docx .
```
